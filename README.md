# Ledesma_finalProject
intro to computing final project for the 1st semester

The file structure instructed from the docs file does not work in my case: 

-Main
    --pages
    --css
    --js
    --images

In the console it reads it as an error, so what I did to the file structure instead is this:

-Main
    --pages
        ---css
        ---js
        ---images
        
Now the file structure worked and connects the css and js file nicely.

PS. I have just added JS as additional to make the menu bar work for smaller screens.
    Followed some tutorials on youtube to get some ideas and feels but eventually did my own thing of the website,
    and added some things that I learned from the tutorials and mixed some of their techniques *Not an expert front end dev lol*.
